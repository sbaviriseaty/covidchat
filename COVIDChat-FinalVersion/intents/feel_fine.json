Remember, according to the CDC, a high percentage of people #nameage.age(s) old could be asymptomatic carriers and pass the COVID-19 virus on to more vulnerable individuals. If possible, I recommend that you try to schedule a test anyways.  Can you tell me what state you live in so that I can connect you to resources in your area?"
